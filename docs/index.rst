Welcome to Flexx's documentation!
=================================

Flexx is a Python tookit for designing user interfaces (UI's), that
uses web technology for its rendering. You can use Flexx to create
desktop applications as well as web applications.

Flexx is pure Python, and has no dependencies other than the browser
that's already installed on the system.

Current status
--------------

Flexx is in development. Many parts of the API may
change. Some things are working (like creation of several widgets and
layouts), other things not (like events).
