Getting started

Dependencies
------------

The only dependency of Flexx is Tornado (a pure Python package). To use
``flexx.ui`` you need a browser. To run apps that look like desktop
apps, we recommend having Firefox installed.

Developers that want to run the tests need:

* pytest (a Python package, get it via conda or pip)
* flake8 (a Python package, get it via conda or pip)
* Nodejs
* Firefox


Installation
------------

* Install a release via ``pip install flexx`` (there are no releases yet)
* This should work: ``python setup.py install``
* Clone the repo and add the root dir to your PYTHONPATH (developer mode)


Release notes
-------------

No releases yet :)
