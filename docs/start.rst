Dependencies
------------

Flexx has no dependencies. To use ``flexx.ui`` you need a browser. To
run apps that look like desktop apps, we recommend having Firefox
installed.


Developer dependencies
----------------------

For running the tests, you need:

* pytest (a Python package, get it via conda or pip)
* flake8 (a Python package, get it via conda or pip)
* Nodejs
* Firefox


Installation
------------

* Install a release via ``pip install flexx`` (there are no releases yet)
* This should work: ``python setup.py install``
* Clone the repo and add the root dir to your PYTHONPATH (developer mode)


Release notes
